# 🔢 BigInt – Arbitrary Precision Integer Library (C++)

## 📖 Overview
`BigInt` is a C++ class that implements **arbitrary precision integers**.  
It allows performing mathematical operations on numbers larger than the built-in C++ types (`int`, `long long`, etc.).

This project is useful for:
- Cryptography
- Competitive programming
- Scientific computations
- Any application requiring **very large numbers**

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Support for **positive & negative numbers**  
- ✅ Handles numbers of **any size** (limited only by memory)  
- ✅ Arithmetic operations:
  - ➕ Addition (`+`, `+=`)
  - ➖ Subtraction (`-`, `-=`)
  - ✖️ Multiplication (`*`, `*=`)
  - ➗ Division (`/`, `/=`)
- ✅ Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)  
- ✅ Efficient removal of leading zeros  
- ✅ Clean and extensible design
